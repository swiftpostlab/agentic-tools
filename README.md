# Agentic Tools

This project packages reusable agent workflows, shareable skills, and supporting automation for agent-oriented repositories. It includes:

- Shareable skill definitions under `.agents/skills/`
- A packaged skills-management CLI for listing, linking, and unlinking skills
- Test setup with pytest
- Linting setup with Black
- Typechecking setup with Pyright

## Requirements

- macOS/Linux: `curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh`
or

uv can manage Python versions directly. To install Python 3.13 via uv: `uv python install 3.13`
