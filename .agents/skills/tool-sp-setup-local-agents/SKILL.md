description: "Audit this machine's local-model setup against the local-setup baseline, then wire up what is missing: accelerator memory and the harness class it can serve, the Ollama server's real configuration, whether an installed model can actually do the job, network exposure, and which client is connected. Use when: setting up a local model for a coding agent on a machine, asking whether this machine's local setup is correct or fast enough, checking why a local agent is slow, silent, or not calling tools, reviewing Ollama's context, keep-alive, KV cache, or host binding, choosing between an agent, an Aider-style assistant, and inline autocomplete for the hardware, or wiring pi, Hermes, or another client to a local endpoint."

# Setup Local Agents

## Purpose

Turn "is my local setup any good?" into a measured answer and a short list of fixes. The audit reads
the machine and the running server rather than asking the user what they configured, because the
common failure is a setting that was never read by the server at all.

## When to use this skill

- Setting up a local model for an agent on a specific machine.
- "Is this machine's setup right?" or "why is my local agent so slow?"
- A local agent is silent for minutes, never calls tools, or truncates mid-session.
- Reviewing an existing Ollama configuration that someone set up a while ago.
- Deciding which class of tool this hardware should run.

## Scope boundaries

This tool audits and fixes **one machine's** setup. It owns the check IDs and the remediation order.

- `ref-sp-agents-local-setup` (hard dependency) owns the **rules**: the fit arithmetic, the harness
  classes, the per-runtime and per-client detail, and the model table. Read it for *why* a check
  exists; use this tool to run the checks against a real machine.
- `tool-sp-setup-agent-repo` wires a *repository* to agent clients. Different subject: that one is
  about files in a repo, this one is about a host's inference stack.

## First step

Run the audit before reading anything else or changing a setting:

```bash
python3 <skill-dir>/scripts/audit_local_setup.py
```

It is read-only, prints one line per check plus the server configuration it saw, and exits non-zero
when a check failed. Flags: `--class agent|edit-format|fim` to audit against a target rather than
what the hardware can afford, `--json` when the output feeds another step, `--only H2,S2` to re-run
a subset after a fix. `uv run <skill-dir>/scripts/audit_local_setup.py` works too; the script is
stdlib-only with PEP 723 metadata.

Do not re-derive this by hand with `systemctl cat`, `nvidia-smi`, and `ollama list`. That is the
slow path the script replaces, and hand-reading misses the variable that is set but undocumented.

## Check IDs

| ID | Checks |
| --- | --- |
| `H1` | An accelerator exists and was detected |
| `H2` | The target harness class is within what the accelerator can serve |
| `S1` | The Ollama server is reachable |
| `S2` | Context length meets the target class's floor |
| `S3` | Keep-alive is set, so a pause does not re-pay prefill |
| `S4` | KV cache quantization on a memory-constrained accelerator |
| `S5` | Concurrency settings do not multiply cache memory |
| `S6` | No undocumented variables masquerading as configuration |
| `N1` | The server is not listening on every interface |
| `N2` | CORS origins are not wildcarded |
| `M1` | At least one model is installed |
| `M2` | A tool-capable model exists, when the class is `agent` |
| `C1` | A known client is present |

Per-check fix procedures are in `./references/remediation.md`. Load it when acting on a finding.

## Core workflow

1. **Audit.** Run the script. Note every non-`pass` check.
2. **Settle the harness class first** (`H2`). It changes what every later check means: a context of
   32K is a failure for an agent and correct for autocomplete. If the hardware cannot serve the
   class the user asked for, say so before fixing anything else, and get agreement on the class.
   The classes and their floors are in `ref-sp-agents-local-setup`.
3. **Read the existing configuration as intent, not as error.** A `0.0.0.0` binding may be a
   deliberate choice to reach the server from a phone. Report it as a finding to confirm, not a
   mistake to silently revert.
4. **Confirm before changing anything that reaches outside the machine** or that restarts a service
   other people may be using. Editing a service unit and restarting the server interrupts whoever is
   mid-session on it.
5. **Fix in order**: harness class → server configuration → security → models → client. Each stage
   assumes the previous one. Procedures in `./references/remediation.md`.
6. **Verify empirically**, not by re-reading the config. See below.
7. **Re-run the audit** and report the remaining non-`pass` checks honestly, including any the user
   declined and why.

## Verify empirically

A configuration file is a claim; the loaded model is the evidence. After any change:

```bash
ollama ps
```

`PROCESSOR` should read `100% GPU`. `CONTEXT` should be the value you set. If `CONTEXT` still shows
the old number, the server never saw the change, which is the single most common outcome of editing
Ollama configuration.

Then prove the harness class actually works:

- **agent**: ask it to read a named file, and confirm a tool is invoked rather than described. Text
  that narrates a tool call is a failure.
- **edit-format**: ask for a one-line edit and confirm the edit block applies cleanly.
- **fim**: type in an editor and confirm a completion appears within a few hundred milliseconds.

## Gotchas

- **Shell exports do not configure the server.** Ollama runs as a background service and reads the
  service environment. `export OLLAMA_CONTEXT_LENGTH=65536` in a terminal changes nothing. This is
  the most common false fix; the audit reads the service config precisely because of it.
- **A silent first turn is prefill, not a hang.** Large system prompts take minutes on slow
  hardware. Raise the client's stream timeout before diagnosing anything as broken.
- **Undocumented variables look authoritative.** `S6` exists because a setting from an older Ollama
  survives upgrades in the service file and quietly does nothing. Do not assume a variable works
  because someone set it; check it against the current documented list.
- **A model with a `tools` capability can still fail under load.** Tool calling degrades as the
  system prompt grows. `M2` is necessary, not sufficient. Test it.
- **`ollama launch <client>` overwrites that client's configuration.** Say so before running it
  against a client the user configured by hand. `--restore` is the undo.
- **Detecting a client on PATH is not the same as it being wired.** `C1` reports presence only.
- **Do not tune constants to one machine.** If a prediction is off, report the gap rather than
  editing the estimate to match a single observation.

## Validation

- Re-run `audit_local_setup.py`; every check is `pass`, `info`, or an explicitly accepted exception.
- `ollama ps` shows the intended context and `100% GPU` for the chosen model.
- The harness class was proven by a real task, not by a configuration read.
- Any check the user declined is reported as declined, not quietly dropped.

## References

- Read `./references/remediation.md` for the per-check fix procedure, in the order to apply them.
- Read `$SKILLS_FOLDER/ref-sp-agents-local-setup/SKILL.md` for the rules behind every check: fit
  arithmetic, harness classes, and the model table.
- Run `$SKILLS_FOLDER/ref-sp-agents-local-setup/scripts/local_model_fit.py` to size specific models
  against this machine. Pass `--context` and `--kv-bytes` to match the server's real settings, and
  `--config` with a model's `config.json` for an exact rather than estimated cache figure.
- Run `./scripts/audit_local_setup.py` for the audit itself; `--help` lists the flags.
