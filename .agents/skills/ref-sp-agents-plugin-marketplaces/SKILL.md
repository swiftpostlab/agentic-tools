# Plugin Marketplaces

## Purpose

Turn a repo that already holds skills into an **agent plugin** published through a **plugin
marketplace**, without restructuring the repo and without leaking skills that were never meant to
leave it.

A plugin is a **cross-client format**, not a Claude-only one. Claude Code, GitHub Copilot CLI, and
VS Code all install plugins, all read a `plugin.json`, and all consume the same `SKILL.md` standard.
One repo, published once, serves all three — see [Cross-client compatibility](#cross-client-compatibility).

This skill is scoped to **distributing skills**. It is not a general plugin-authoring guide: hooks,
MCP servers, LSP servers, agents, and commands are plugin components too, but they are out of scope
here — consult the upstream references for those. What this skill owns is the part that is genuinely
easy to get wrong: **which directories get published, how paths survive the install cache, and how a
release reaches an existing user.**

## When to use this skill

- Packaging an existing skills directory as a plugin.
- Creating a `marketplace.json` catalog, or choosing where to host it.
- Deciding which skills are allowed into a published plugin.
- Making one published plugin installable from Claude Code, Copilot CLI, and VS Code.
- Cutting a release, or choosing between pinned and rolling versioning.
- Debugging an installed plugin that is missing skills, or that will not update.

## Scope boundaries

This skill owns **publishing** — the manifests, the enumeration, the install cache, the release.
It is one of two ways skills leave a repo; pick by how the consumer gets them.

- `ref-sp-agents-skills-management` — the other way out: linking and syncing skills into a consuming
  repo from a source it already has. Use that when the consumer is a repo you control; use this when
  the consumer *installs* the skills from a marketplace.
- `ref-sp-agents-shareable-skills` — owns the visibility tiers this skill's manifest must respect,
  and the validator that enforces the two against each other. It decides what *may* be published;
  this skill decides how.
- `ref-sp-dev-semantic-versioning` and `ref-sp-dev-package-management` — what a version number means
  and how it stays in sync across manifests. This skill only owns why a stale plugin version freezes
  users.
- Hooks, MCP servers, LSP servers, agents, and commands are plugin components too, but they are out
  of scope here.

## The mental model

Three nested things, often conflated:

| Thing | What it is | Where it lives |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Skill** | A directory with a `SKILL.md`. | `<skills-root>/<skill-name>/` |
| **Plugin** | A self-contained directory of components. Bundles skills. | Its **plugin root** |
| **Marketplace** | A catalog listing plugins and where to fetch them. | `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` at a git repo root |

Users add a marketplace once, then install plugins from that catalog. A marketplace is **not** a
central registry — it is a JSON file in a git repo, so a marketplace is exactly as private as its
hosting.

**Your skills already have the right shape.** Clients read only `name`, `description`, and
`disable-model-invocation` from `SKILL.md` frontmatter and **ignore unrecognized `metadata.*` keys**,
so a repo's own governance metadata (ownership, domain, visibility, dependencies) rides along inside a
published plugin untouched. Nothing needs stripping.

## Critical rules

These four are where publishing goes wrong. Everything else is detail.

### 1. Skills do not have to live in `skills/`

`plugin.json` and marketplace plugin entries both accept a **`skills`** field — a path or array of
paths (`"skills": ["./.agents/skills/"]`). Paths resolve **relative to the plugin root**, and Claude
requires the `./` prefix. So a repo whose skills sit somewhere unconventional does **not** need to
move them: make the repo root the plugin root and point `skills` at the existing directory.

### 2. `skills` normally *adds*, but a marketplace-root source makes it *replace*

This is the rule that decides what actually ships:

- Normally, the default `skills/` directory is **always scanned**, and paths in `skills` load
  *alongside* it.
- **Exception:** when a marketplace entry's `source` resolves to the **marketplace root**
  (`"source": "./"`), the listed paths become **the complete set** — other directories do not load.
  Listing the container directory itself, or the plugin root, keeps the full scan. If none of the
  listed paths exist, the default scan runs instead.

Consequence: with a marketplace-root source, **enumerating individual skill directories is the only
mechanism for publishing a subset.** Pointing at the container publishes everything in it.

```jsonc
"source": "./",
"skills": ["./skills/code-review", "./skills/docs"]   // exactly these two ship
```

This replace-versus-add rule is **documented for Claude Code and unverified elsewhere** — the Copilot
and VS Code docs are silent on it. Since the enumeration is what enforces a visibility policy, do not
assume it carries over: prove it with a real install before publishing to those clients.

### 3. Nothing may traverse outside the plugin root

Plugins are copied into a version cache on install — for Claude,
`~/.claude/plugins/cache/<marketplace>/<plugin>/<version>/`; other clients use their own cache
locations, listed in the compatibility reference. Any path that reaches upward through a
parent-directory segment (`..`) to something like a shared utils folder does **not** work after
installation, because those files are never copied into the cache. Symlinks are the escape hatch, and
their behavior depends on where the target resolves:

| Symlink target | Behavior on install |
| --- | --- |
| Within the plugin's own directory | Preserved as a relative symlink |
| Elsewhere within the same marketplace | **Dereferenced** — content is copied in |
| Outside the marketplace | **Skipped**, for security |

Prefer naming the real paths in `skills` over building a symlink farm.

### 4. A stale `version` silently freezes your users

A plugin's version resolves from the **first** of these that is set:

1. `version` in `plugin.json`
2. `version` in the marketplace entry
3. the git commit SHA of the plugin's source

Two traps follow, and both fail *silently*:

- **Setting `version` pins the plugin.** If `plugin.json` says `"version": "1.0.0"`, pushing new
  commits without changing that string ships **nothing** to existing users — the client sees the same
  version and keeps the cached copy. Bump it every release, or omit it entirely.
- **Never set `version` in both `plugin.json` and the marketplace entry.** `plugin.json` always wins,
  with no warning, so a stale manifest can mask the version you set in the catalog.

The ban is on the **plugin entry** inside `marketplace.json`'s `plugins` array. A `version` under the
catalog's own top-level `metadata` is a different field describing the catalog, and setting it
alongside `plugin.json.version` is correct, not a conflict. The two look identical in a grep for
`"version"` across `.claude-plugin/`, which is a good way to talk yourself into "fixing" a manifest
that was already right — check which object the field sits in before touching it.

Wire the version into the release tool rather than bumping it by hand. In this repo, Commitizen's
`version_files` in `pyproject.toml` rewrites `.claude-plugin/plugin.json:version` and
`.claude-plugin/marketplace.json:version` alongside `package.json` and `VERSION`, so one `cz bump`
keeps every manifest on the same number. A version a human has to remember to bump is a version that
silently freezes users.

### Enforce the enumeration, do not trust it

Because rule 2 makes the `skills` list the complete published set, that list — not the frontmatter —
is what actually enforces your visibility policy. Nothing in the plugin format checks it, so a
`repo-local` skill added to the list ships to the world, and a renamed folder silently drops out.

Validate it mechanically. The sharing-spec validator
(`ref-sp-agents-shareable-skills`, `scripts/validate-sharing.mts <skills-root> --all`) cross-checks
the manifest against the catalog: it errors on a non-public skill being listed, on a dangling path,
and on listing the container while non-public skills live inside it; it warns when a public skill is
missing from the manifest. Run it before cutting a release.

## Cross-client compatibility

Every client auto-detects the plugin manifest, and **`.claude-plugin/` is in every search order**:

| Client | Manifest search order |
| --- | --- |
| Claude Code | `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` |
| Copilot CLI | `.plugin/plugin.json` → `plugin.json` → `.github/plugin/plugin.json` → `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` |
| VS Code | the same four as Copilot CLI |

Copilot CLI looks for the catalog in `.github/plugin/marketplace.json` **and in
`.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`**. VS Code additionally expands `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}`.

**So a repo laid out for Claude Code is already installable from Copilot CLI and VS Code.** Shipping a
second `.github/plugin/` copy of the manifests is duplication, not compatibility — keep one set under
`.claude-plugin/`. Third-party posts that tell you to maintain both manifests are working from the
wrong detection order.

What genuinely differs — install commands, default marketplaces, VS Code's `chat.plugins.*` settings,
enterprise-managed plugins, install cache locations, and the component types Copilot supports that
Claude does not — is in [`./references/cross-agent-compat.md`](./references/cross-agent-compat.md).

## Publishing procedure

1. **Decide the publish set.** Filter skills by the repo's visibility policy — see
   [Visibility mapping](#visibility-mapping). A published plugin must never carry a skill the repo
   marks as local-only.
2. **Choose the plugin root.** Simplest is the repo root, which then doubles as the marketplace root;
   the plugin entry's `source` becomes `"./"`.
3. **Write the manifests.** `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` (the plugin) and
   `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` (the catalog). Only `plugin.json` belongs inside
   `.claude-plugin/` — component directories live at the plugin root. See
   [`./references/manifests.md`](./references/manifests.md) for both schemas, all `source` types, and
   `strict` mode.
4. **Generate the skills list, do not hand-write it.** Enumerated paths must track the catalog, and a
   hand-maintained list drifts the moment someone adds a skill. Derive it from the visibility metadata
   the skills already carry, commit the generated manifests, and add a drift check to CI so adding a
   skill without regenerating fails the build.
5. **Choose the release model** — see [Releasing](#releasing).
6. **Prove the install before announcing it.** Add the marketplace, install, confirm the expected
   skill count, and confirm no local-only skill leaked. Do this **once per client the marketplace
   claims to support**. Then check the always-on cost: every published skill's `description` loads
   into **every session**, so the publish set is a token budget, not just a policy question.

The whole Claude flow has a **non-interactive CLI equivalent**, so the proof can be scripted rather
than driven through slash commands in a session:

```bash
# Claude Code
claude plugin marketplace add <owner>/<repo>      # add the catalog
claude plugin marketplace list                    # catalogs currently configured
claude plugin install <plugin>@<marketplace>      # note: marketplace NAME, not repo
claude plugin list                                # what is installed, and ignored-folder warnings
claude plugin details <plugin>@<marketplace>      # components, descriptions, token cost
/plugin marketplace update                        # refresh it later
/reload-plugins                                   # pick up non-skill component changes in-session

# Copilot CLI
copilot plugin marketplace add <owner>/<repo>
copilot plugin install <plugin>@<marketplace>
copilot plugin list
```

**The `@` suffix is the marketplace's `name` field, not the repo.** A catalog added as
`<owner>/<repo>` installs as `<plugin>@<name-from-marketplace.json>`, and the two are usually
different strings. Read the name out of the manifest rather than guessing it from the add command.

Skills namespace as `/<plugin>:<skill>`, so the plugin name is a user-visible prefix on every skill.
Keep it short. This is also why a skill's own owner-prefix stays useful: it lets the same directories
be consumed both as plain skills and as plugin skills with no rename.

## Releasing

**There is no build artifact.** For the git-based source types, the client clones the repo and copies
the plugin directory into its cache. Nothing is compiled, bundled, or uploaded. "Releasing" is
therefore purely a versioning decision:

| Model | How | When to choose it |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Rolling** | Omit `version` entirely; every commit to the tracked ref is a new version, keyed by commit SHA. | Internal or actively-developed plugins. Release == merge. |
| **Pinned** | `plugin.json.version` is bumped on every release. | The repo already has real releases — a version file, a changelog, a conventional-commit bump tool. The plugin manifest becomes **one more manifest in the existing version-sync set**, and the release flow is the one the repo already has. |

Pick **pinned** whenever the repo already versions itself; wire the plugin version into the existing
bump rather than maintaining a second, divergent version. Users then receive the release on their next
marketplace update or background auto-update.

One subtlety with `"source": "./"`: the content served is whatever the marketplace clone's ref holds,
so a *fresh* install between releases serves newer default-branch content under the older version
label. Existing users correctly stay cached until the version bumps, so this is a label skew, not a
correctness bug. For a hard-pinned channel, give the plugin entry an explicit git source with a
`ref` on a release tag instead of `"./"`, at the cost of bumping that ref every release.

Stable/latest channels are built the same way: two marketplaces pointing at different refs of the same
repo. **Each channel must resolve to a different version**, or the client treats them as identical and
skips the update.

Full detail — version resolution, auto-update tokens, channels, cache lifetime:
[`./references/releasing.md`](./references/releasing.md).

## Visibility mapping

A repo that already tiers its skills for sharing maps straight onto the hosting model. The tiers below
use this repo's vocabulary (`repo-local` / `organization` / `public`, owned by the sharing spec);
substitute the equivalent tiers of whatever policy the repo runs.

| Tier | Marketplace form | Mechanism |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `public` | Public git repo; optionally submit to a community marketplace. | `/plugin marketplace add <owner>/<repo>` |
| `organization` | **Private** git repo. | `extraKnownMarketplaces` (Claude) or `chat.plugins.marketplaces` (VS Code) pre-registers it for teammates; background auto-update needs a token env var, since credential helpers are not available at startup. |
| `repo-local` | Never published. A local `directory`/`file` source stays fully offline if you want it loadable at all. | Must be **excluded** from the published `skills` list. |

The tier is enforced by **what you enumerate**, nothing else. No client has a notion of skill-level
visibility — each publishes whatever the manifest lists. That makes the generator in step 4 the actual
enforcement point, and the CI drift check the thing that keeps it honest.

See [`./references/visibility-and-hosting.md`](./references/visibility-and-hosting.md) for private-repo
credentials, `extraKnownMarketplaces`, air-gapped sources, and the public marketplaces.

## Gotchas

- **A plugin bundling many skills costs tokens in every session**, because all their descriptions load
  at discovery. Bundling everything into one plugin keeps intra-repo skill dependencies from crossing a
  plugin boundary, which is usually the right trade — but it makes description discipline a
  distribution concern, not just a style one. Measured on this repo's first publish: **47 skills,
  ~4,710 always-on tokens**, so budget roughly **100 tokens per published skill** and treat an
  outlier description as a real cost. `claude plugin details` prints the per-skill breakdown, which is
  the fastest way to find the descriptions worth trimming.
- **`marketplace add` writes `extraKnownMarketplaces` into user settings.** The manual add and the
  org-wide pre-registration described under [Visibility mapping](#visibility-mapping) are not two
  mechanisms — pre-registering is just shipping the entry the add command would have written.
- **It clones over SSH when git is configured for SSH**, not the HTTPS path the credential docs
  centre on. For a private-repo marketplace that changes which credential has to work: interactive
  installs go through `ssh-agent` and `known_hosts`, while background auto-update still needs the
  token env var, because it runs without either.
- **`strict: false` plus a `plugin.json` that declares components is a hard load failure.** Choose one
  authority: the manifest (`strict: true`, the default) or the marketplace entry (`strict: false`).
- **Relative `source` paths break in URL-distributed marketplaces.** If users add the marketplace by a
  direct URL to `marketplace.json`, only that file is fetched, so `"./…"` cannot resolve. Use a git or
  npm source for URL-based distribution.
- **Components inside `.claude-plugin/` are not found.** Only `plugin.json` goes there.
- **Editing a `SKILL.md` takes effect immediately; other components do not.** Run `/reload-plugins`.
- **Do not write state into the plugin directory.** Its path changes on every update. Use the plugin's
  persistent data directory.
- **A project-level skill of the same name shadows the plugin's.** Copilot CLI and VS Code resolve
  skills and agents first-found, with project-level components winning over plugin ones.

## Validation

Before announcing a marketplace:

- The published skill list matches the repo's visibility policy — no local-only skill is enumerated.
- The manifests are generated, committed, and covered by a drift check in CI.
- `version` appears in exactly one place, and the release flow bumps it.
- A real install from the hosted marketplace produces the expected skill count, in **each client the
  marketplace claims to support**.
- Skills still validate against the repo's own skill and sharing validators — publishing changes
  packaging, not authoring standards.
