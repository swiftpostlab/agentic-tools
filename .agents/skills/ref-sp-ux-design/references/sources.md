# Sources and provenance

Every dated or numeric claim in this skill, mapped to its primary, the date it was verified, and what
would invalidate it.

Content verified **2026-08-02**.

## Claim tiers

| Tier | What it is | Treatment |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Perceptual / cognitive research | Durable. Cite the primary. Respect its scope. |
| 2 | Normative standard | Binding, versioned. Quote the version. |
| 3 | Practitioner research | Real data, known bounds, often old. State year and n. |
| 4 | Design-system convention | Internally consistent, not empirical. Label it. |
| 5 | Folklore | Name and refute — see `folklore.md`. |

**Vendor design systems are interested parties.** Material 3 and Apple's HIG are tier 4: authoritative
about their own platform, not evidence about human perception.

## Corroborated but NOT primary-verified

These are used in the skill and were **not** confirmed against the primary document during this
pass. Re-verify before they become load-bearing in a deliverable.

## Deliberate omissions

- **Material 3 type scale token values.** The page renders them in a token viewer rather than a
  table; only unit conversions were recoverable (Android sp ↔ Web rem at 0.0625; tracking em =
  tracking px / font size sp). Not load-bearing — M3 itself says "No single product will use all the
  styles."
- **Apple's 44 × 44 pt tap target.** Not captured verbatim from the pages fetched, so it is not
  cited as an Apple figure anywhere in this skill. The citable version is WCAG SC 2.5.5 (AAA), whose
  value is owned by `.agents/skills/ref-sp-ux-accessibility/references/thresholds.md`.
- **The grouping-conflict ordering** in `foundations.md` (common region > proximity > similarity) is
  labelled tier 4 in place: a working heuristic, not a finding from Wagemans.
