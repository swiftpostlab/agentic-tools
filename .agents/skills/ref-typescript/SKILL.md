# TypeScript

## Purpose

Provide portable TypeScript defaults that keep types honest, runtime boundaries explicit, and code readable under strict settings.

## When to use this skill

- Writing or refactoring TypeScript modules or scripts.
- Deciding how to model states, responses, and shared types.
- Reviewing TypeScript config and type-checking strictness.
- Handling unknown external data safely.

## Scope Boundaries

- Use this skill for strict TypeScript design, runtime boundaries, and package-level structure.
- Use `.agents/skills/ref-javascript/SKILL.md` when the code intentionally stays in plain JavaScript with JSDoc rather than full TypeScript.
- Use `.agents/skills/ref-coding-patterns/SKILL.md` for language-agnostic naming, comments, CLI ergonomics, and testing defaults.
- Use `.agents/skills/ref-architecture/SKILL.md` for generic feature-boundary or shared-utility decisions that are not TypeScript-specific.

## Defaults

- Prefer strict mode and keep it strict.
- Prefer `unknown` plus narrowing over `any`.
- Prefer discriminated unions for stateful variants.
- Prefer explicit runtime validation at trust boundaries.
- Prefer inference inside small local scopes and explicit annotations at exported or shared boundaries.
- Prefer `.ts` for ordinary TypeScript modules and feature code.
- Prefer `.mts` for Node ESM scripts that are executed directly by Node and need the extension to communicate module format clearly.

## Task Framing

| Command or action | What | Why | When | Expected outcome |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Model a runtime boundary | Decide where external data becomes validated domain data. | TypeScript is safest when compile-time certainty matches runtime reality. | When reading network, file, env, or parsed JSON input. | The code narrows or validates untrusted input before use. |
| Place types and features | Keep package-owned code and its local types under a readable `src/<feature>/` layout. | Deeply shared `types/` folders often grow faster than the actual features they serve. | When starting or reorganizing a package. | The feature and the types it owns are easy to find together. |
| Review strictness and readability | Check whether utility types, generics, and unions are helping or obscuring the model. | Strictness loses value when the types stop communicating intent. | When reviewing or refactoring a non-trivial TypeScript module. | Runtime safety stays strong without burying the domain in type tricks. |

## Core Rules

### Type design

- Model states and variants with unions instead of optional-property soup.
- Use utility types sparingly and only when they clarify intent.
- Avoid deep type-level cleverness when a simple domain type would read better.

### Runtime boundaries

- Treat network data, filesystem data, environment variables, and parsed JSON as untrusted until validated.
- Narrow `unknown` with guards or validation helpers before use.
- Do not let compile-time confidence hide missing runtime checks.

### Code structure

- Keep types close to the feature or module that owns them.
- Extract shared types only when they are truly shared.
- Prefer readable named functions and objects over dense callback chains.

### File and config conventions

- Use `.ts` for package code, browser-oriented modules, and most feature files.
- Use `.mts` for repo scripts or Node-run ESM entrypoints when the runtime or surrounding repo conventions rely on explicit module extensions.
- Use `.d.ts` for ambient declarations or globals that support the main code, such as userscript global definitions.
- Split `tsconfig` files by runtime surface when a repo mixes Node scripts, browser modules, and userscripts instead of forcing one project file to describe incompatible environments.

## Example Layouts

### TypeScript package in a monorepo

```text
packages/package-name/
  src/
    invoice-import/
      index.ts
      parse-csv.ts
      parse-csv.test.ts
      types.ts
```

### Small feature with local validation

```text
src/
  session-state/
    index.ts
    validate-session.ts
    validate-session.test.ts
```

### Node ESM scripts with a dedicated TypeScript project

```text
scripts/
  generate-catalog.mts
  refresh-manifest.mts
tsconfig.json
```

## Gotchas

- Strict compile-time checks do not replace runtime validation for external data.
- `unknown` is only safer than `any` if the code actually narrows it before use.
- Large type-level abstractions can hide the domain model instead of clarifying it.

## Validation

- No new `any` escapes or unchecked casts were introduced without strong justification.
- External input is validated before domain logic uses it.
- Shared types are easy to locate and easy to understand.
- The resulting code remains readable to someone who did not write the types.
