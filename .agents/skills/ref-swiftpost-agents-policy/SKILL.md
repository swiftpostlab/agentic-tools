# Swiftpost Agents Policy

## Purpose

Document this repository's concrete AI policy implementation: the canonical policy file, the grouped `agentic-tools policy` CLI surface, the generated client outputs, and the service-selection model that decides which vendors receive managed files.

## When to use this skill

- Editing `src/agentic_tools/agents_policy/`.
- Updating policy docs, CI enforcement, or command references in this repo.
- Debugging why `.aiexclude`, `.claude/settings.json`, or `.vscode/settings.json` did or did not change.
- Explaining how the `policy` section in `.agents/config.json` should be authored in this repo.

## Stable Surface

- Canonical policy file: `.agents/config.json` with a top-level `policy` object
- Canonical commands:
  - `uv run agentic-tools policy sync`
  - `uv run agentic-tools policy check`
  - `uv run agentic-tools policy import-vscode`
- Python implementation path: `src/agentic_tools/agents_policy/main.py`
- Node implementation path: `src/agentic_tools/agents_policy/main.mjs`
- Packaged CLI entrypoint: `agentic-tools`; standalone policy bins are not exported.

## Policy Model

The source-of-truth file is JSON. Its top-level `policy` object currently supports these main fields:

- `services` — list of enabled client outputs, such as `gemini`, `claude`, and `copilot`
- `protectedFiles` — sensitive patterns that should be blocked or deterred
- `excludedFiles` — noisy or generated patterns that should stay out of Gemini/native exclusion when enabled
- `terminalAutoApprove` — managed VS Code terminal approval map for Copilot-related tooling
- `editAutoApprove` — managed VS Code edit approval map

If `services` is omitted, the implementation defaults to all supported services.

## Generated Outputs

| Service | Output | Behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `gemini` | `.aiexclude` | Generated from `protectedFiles` and `excludedFiles`. If Gemini is disabled, the managed file is removed. |
| `claude` | `.claude/settings.json` | Managed `permissions.deny` `Read(...)` rules track `protectedFiles`. If Claude is disabled, managed read rules are cleaned. |
| `copilot` | `.vscode/settings.json` | Managed file associations, Copilot language disablement, and approval maps track the policy. If Copilot is disabled, the managed sections are cleaned. |

## Command Behavior

### `uv run agentic-tools policy sync`

- Finds the nearest `.agents/config.json` with a `policy` object, with `.agents/policy.json` and legacy `.ai-policy.json` fallback.
- Loads the policy file, validates `services`, and syncs the enabled outputs.
- Cleans managed sections for disabled outputs so stale vendor files do not linger.

### `uv run agentic-tools policy check`

- Resolves the same policy and generated output paths as the normal sync flow.
- Compares the current managed files to the generated contents without rewriting them.
- Exits with an error when drift exists and tells the user to run either `uv run agentic-tools policy sync` or `uv run agentic-tools policy import-vscode`.

### `uv run agentic-tools policy import-vscode`

- Imports current VS Code approval maps into the policy section first.
- Writes the updated policy back to `.agents/config.json` when using unified config.
- Runs the same sync flow afterward.

## Decision Rules

- Use `.agents/config.json` as the source of truth for new work.
- Prefer `services` to control vendor coverage instead of hand-editing generated files.
- Keep `.aiexclude` at the repo root; do not replace it with a made-up Gemini-only ignore file.
- Treat `.claude/settings.json` and `.vscode/settings.json` as partially managed outputs, not primary authoring surfaces for policy-owned sections.
- Keep docs and CI on the canonical `agentic-tools policy` command family; do not add standalone policy entrypoints.

## Validation

- Run `uv run agentic-tools policy sync` after changing `.agents/config.json` or the sync implementation.
- Run `uv run agentic-tools policy check` in CI or before commit flows that should reject policy drift without mutating files.
- Run `uv run python -m pytest src/agentic_tools/agents_policy/main_test.py -q` when changing policy logic.
- Check CI drift enforcement in `.github/workflows/ci.yaml` if output file names or command names change.
- Keep `.aiexclude`, `.claude/settings.json`, and `.vscode/settings.json` aligned with the current policy file.
