# Projects Architecture

## Purpose

Provide portable repository and feature-structure defaults that keep codebases modular, discoverable, and resistant to accidental coupling.

## When to use this skill

- Designing the folder layout for a new feature or tool.
- Deciding whether code belongs in product source or in maintenance scripts.
- Reviewing whether a feature has grown beyond one file or one folder.
- Choosing when shared utilities are justified.
- Refactoring a repository that has started to blur boundaries.

## Scope Boundaries

- Use this skill for portable structure decisions such as feature boundaries, shared-utility thresholds, and product-versus-maintenance separation.
- Use a repo-local conventions skill (in this repo, `ref-sp-dev-repo-conventions`) when the question is about a specific repository's exact top-level folders, `pyproject.toml`, or agent wiring.
- Use `ref-sp-py-python`, `ref-sp-js-javascript`, or `ref-sp-js-typescript` when the question is about language-specific folder shapes.
- Use `ref-sp-js-web-standalone-template` when the structure question is specific to a browser-only local app or mini-tool.

## Defaults

- Prefer feature-first organization over type-based dumping grounds.
- Keep product code under the main source tree.
- Keep maintenance and repo automation separate from product features.
- Keep tests near the code they explain when the project layout allows it.
- Add a short `README.md` at the root of each real feature folder so the feature's purpose and entrypoints are obvious without reading code first.
- Extract shared utilities only after real reuse appears.
- In mixed Python and Node repositories, keep Python package features under `src/<package>/<feature>/` and keep Node or TypeScript package features in the matching feature slice instead of inventing a parallel top-level tree.
- In mixed Python and Node repositories, use `scripts/` for thin runtime entrypoint shims, dev automation, migrations, or one-off maintenance, not for the owning implementation of installed commands.

## Task Framing

| Command or action | What | Why | When | Expected outcome |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Define feature boundaries | Decide what belongs inside one feature slice and what should stay outside it. | Clear ownership reduces coupling and makes refactors cheaper. | When creating a new feature or splitting a large one. | The owning folder is obvious and internal details stay internal. |
| Promote product code out of maintenance paths | Move shipped or user-facing behavior under the main source tree instead of leaving it in `scripts/`. | Prototype placement often lingers long after the code becomes part of the product. | When a script becomes a real feature or installed command. | Product code is discoverable and tested like the rest of the source tree. |
| Decide whether to share a utility | Judge whether repeated logic is stable enough to extract or still cheap to duplicate locally. | Premature sharing creates invisible dependencies and vague utility buckets. | When two or more features start to reuse similar helpers. | Shared code exists for real reuse and has a clear home. |

## Core Rules

### Feature boundaries

- Give each feature a folder or slice that is easy to find and reason about.
- Keep the code, tests, and local assets that change together close together.
- When a feature has its own folder, add a short `README.md` there that explains what the feature owns, where the main entrypoints live, and how to validate it.
- Avoid letting one feature depend directly on another feature's internals.

### Shared code

- Create shared utilities only when reuse is real and stable.
- Do not create a global `utils` or `helpers` bucket unless it has clear internal categories.
- Prefer duplication of tiny stable code over premature shared abstractions that create coupling.

### Product code vs maintenance scripts

- If code is a user-facing feature of the product or package, keep it under the main source tree.
- If code is repo maintenance, migration, scaffolding, or one-off automation, keep it in `scripts/` or the equivalent maintenance area.
- If an installed CLI needs a runtime entry file, keep the implementation under the owning feature in `src/` and let `scripts/` hold only the smallest executable shim that calls into that feature.
- Do not leave product behavior buried in maintenance scripts just because it started as a prototype.

### Mixed Python and JavaScript or TypeScript setup

- When a repo ships both Python and Node surfaces, let each language keep its normal packaging and config entrypoints while sharing the same feature names and folder ownership.
- Prefer colocated `main.py` and `main_test.py` for Python plus the matching Node files for the same feature when both runtimes expose that surface.
- For no-build npm packages or Git-installed CLIs that run from `node_modules`, prefer `.mjs` plus JSDoc, such as `main.mjs` and `main.test.mjs`, so the package does not rely on TypeScript runtime stripping.
- When TypeScript is the selected Node surface and it is not shipped as directly executed package runtime, use `main.ts` and `main.test.ts` for the same feature.
- Keep Python packaging in `pyproject.toml`, keep Node packaging in `package.json`, and split language-specific config such as `tsconfig` files by runtime surface instead of forcing one config file to describe everything.
- Keep shared cross-runtime helpers narrow and explicit so a feature does not quietly depend on another language surface's internals.

### Naming and discoverability

- Choose folder names that match the domain or workflow they contain.
- Keep file names descriptive enough that a reader can predict the contents before opening them.
- Avoid over-generic folder names when a narrower domain name exists.
- When sibling directories or files form a sequence rather than independent peers, prefix each name with a fixed-width number so the natural sort matches the intended order — `10-new/`, `20-open/`, `90-closed/`.

**Where the numeric-prefix convention comes from.** It is the Linux `.d`-directory pattern, inherited
from SysV init (`/etc/rc3.d/S20apache2`) and formalised by systemd's drop-in configuration
directories. `man 5 sysctl.d` states the rule: configuration files are "sorted by their filename in
lexicographic order," and it "is recommended to prefix all filenames with a two-digit number and a
dash." The number is not metadata — nothing parses it — it exists only so that string sorting yields
the intended order. That mechanism dictates the practices: pad to a fixed width, because `9-` sorts
*after* `10-` under string comparison; leave gaps (step 10) so a later insertion never forces a
renumber; and reserve the top of the range for local overrides, the near-universal `99-` idiom. Apply
it only where order changes meaning — `/etc/modprobe.d` and `/etc/cron.d` are deliberately unnumbered
because their entries are independent. One caveat when borrowing it: `.d` numbers encode *priority
among simultaneous entries*, while a lifecycle encodes a *sequence*. The sorting trick is shared, the
semantics are not, so do not import priority idioms such as a `50-` neutral centre into a sequence.

### Growth path

- Start small, but keep a path open for splitting files as complexity grows.
- Extract pure helpers before extracting stateful orchestration.
- If a file is hard to scan, split by responsibility inside the same feature before introducing repo-wide infrastructure.

## Example Layouts

### Python package with feature-first layout

```text
scripts/ (only for devs, not installed with the package)
  data-migration.py
  generate-docs.py
src/package_name/
  billing/
    main.py
    main_test.py
    service.py
    service_test.py
```

### Mixed Python and no-build Node package

```text
scripts/
  billing-cli.mjs
src/package_name/
  billing/
    main.py
    main_test.py
    main.mjs
    main.test.mjs
  utils/
    common.mjs
```

### Standalone browser tool with local assets

```text
scripts/ (only for devs, not installed with the package)
  data-migration.mjs/mts
  generate-docs.mjs/mts
src/features/billing/
  index.html
  app.js
  styles.css
```

## Validation

- A new engineer can find the owning feature quickly.
- Product code is not hidden inside maintenance paths.
- Shared utilities exist because of real reuse, not prediction.
- Feature boundaries are explicit and avoid backdoor dependencies.
- Tests live close enough to their source that maintenance stays cheap.
- Ordered sibling names use a fixed-width numeric prefix, so a plain lexicographic listing shows them in their real order.
