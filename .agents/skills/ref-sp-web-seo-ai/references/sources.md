# Sources and Verification

This is the **fastest-rotting** material in the `web` family. Everything here was true on the
verified date and may not be true now. Check before you assert.

**Last full verification: 2026-07-12.**

A worked demonstration of why this matters: the first draft of this skill was written and, within the
same working session, a freshness pass found two of its claims already superseded — Search Console had
gained a Generative AI performance report, and Google had published an AI optimization guide. Neither
existed in the docs the draft was built from. Assume the same is happening now.

## How to re-verify (cheapest path first)

1. **Check the documentation changelog** for the docs named below:

   ```sh
   curl -s https://developers.google.com/search/updates/search_docs_updates.rss
   ```

2. **Check the Search Central blog** — AI features are announced there before the reference docs are
   updated, so for this skill the blog is a *primary* source, not a backstop:
   <https://developers.google.com/search/blog>

3. **Fetch the flagged documents** and compare against the "Claim" column.

4. **For non-Google assistants there is no changelog.** OpenAI, Anthropic, and Perplexity publish
   crawler documentation but do not version it usefully. Re-fetch the operator's own docs (linked
   below) and treat anything you cannot confirm there as unverified.

5. **Update the claim, the row, and both last-verified dates**, and tell the user what moved.

## Section: The honest position — independent corroboration

The strongest evidence in this skill, because it is **not** Google talking about Google.

| Claim in SKILL.md | Source | Verified | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| "Bing and Copilot search experiences rely on the same core crawling, indexing, and ranking foundation as traditional search. SEO best practices… also support eligibility for AI-generated experiences, grounding results, and citations." Section title: *"SEO Fundamentals Still Apply to Grounding and AI Experiences"* | [Bing Webmaster Guidelines](https://www.bing.com/webmasters/help/webmaster-guidelines-30fba23a) | 2026-07-12 | **Independent of Google.** Two engines with two AI surfaces both say the lever is ordinary SEO. This is what upgrades "no special AI optimization" from a vendor claim to a corroborated one. |
| Bing lists *"Hiding critical content behind client-side rendering"* under **Avoid**; *"Content that cannot be reliably rendered may not be indexed or selected for grounding results."* | [Bing Webmaster Guidelines](https://www.bing.com/webmasters/help/webmaster-guidelines-30fba23a) | 2026-07-12 | Confirms the one genuinely load-bearing technical requirement for AI visibility: be renderable without JS. |

**Reading Bing requires a real browser.** The page returns HTTP 200 to `curl` and is a client-rendered
JavaScript shell — a non-rendering fetch gets the title and no body. Use
`.agents/skills/ref-sp-dev-playwright-cli/SKILL.md`:

```sh
yarn playwright open
yarn playwright goto "https://www.bing.com/webmasters/help/webmaster-guidelines-30fba23a"
```

The canonical path is `webmaster-guidelines` (singular); the plural redirects. Note the irony and take
the lesson: Bing's own guidance against hiding content behind client-side rendering is itself hidden
behind client-side rendering.

## Provenance — non-Google crawlers

The user-agent names in SKILL.md's crawler table. These are the operators' own docs; there is no
central registry, and operators add and rename crawlers without notice. **Re-fetch before advising a
`robots.txt` change** — a stale user-agent string in a `robots.txt` is a silent no-op.

All rows below were **content-read**, not merely status-checked: each operator's page was fetched and
its user-agent tokens confirmed in the text.

| Operator | Documented tokens | Source | Verified |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| OpenAI | `GPTBot` (training), `OAI-SearchBot` (ChatGPT search), `ChatGPT-User` (user-initiated), `OAI-AdsBot` (ad validation) | <https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/bots> | 2026-07-12 |
| Anthropic | `ClaudeBot` (training), `Claude-SearchBot` (search quality), `Claude-User` (user-initiated) | <https://support.claude.com/en/articles/8896518-does-anthropic-crawl-data-from-the-web-and-how-can-site-owners-block-the-crawler> | 2026-07-12 |
| Perplexity | `PerplexityBot` (automatic, for search inclusion), `Perplexity-User` (user-initiated — **"generally ignores robots.txt rules"**) | <https://docs.perplexity.ai/guides/bots> | 2026-07-12 |
| Google | `Google-Extended` (training/grounding in Google's *other* systems; **not** Search ranking, **not** AI Overviews) | <https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/ai-features> | 2026-07-12 |
| Common Crawl | `CCBot` — respects `robots.txt`, offers a separate opt-out registry, and is verifiable by reverse DNS (`*.crawl.commoncrawl.org`) | <https://commoncrawl.org/ccbot> | 2026-07-12 |

**What reading these actually changed** — a record of why "resolves" is not "verified":

- **Anthropic runs three crawlers, not one.** The table previously listed only `ClaudeBot`, missing
  `Claude-User` and `Claude-SearchBot` entirely. Advice based on the old table would have left two
  bots unaddressed.
- **Anthropic's documentation moved** from `support.anthropic.com` to `support.claude.com` (301).
- **`Perplexity-User` generally ignores `robots.txt`.** This is documented by Perplexity itself and it
  breaks the assumption underneath most crawler-blocking advice: you cannot use `robots.txt` to stop a
  human pasting your URL into an assistant. Any advice promising otherwise is wrong.
- The three-job pattern (training / search / user-initiated) only became visible once all the pages
  were read. It is the durable model; the token names are not.

**Still assume incompleteness.** Operators ship new bots without announcement. Re-read these pages
before advising a `robots.txt` change — a misspelled or retired user-agent is a silent no-op.

**Two live examples of why this table exists**, both found while writing it:

- OpenAI's bot documentation **moved**. `platform.openai.com/docs/bots` now 301s to the URL above. A
  redirect today is a 404 tomorrow.
- Google's crawler documentation **moved** out of Search Central into a separate "Crawling
  Infrastructure" section (`/crawling/docs/...`). The old
  `search/docs/crawling-indexing/overview-google-crawlers` page still returns 200 but **does not
  document `Google-Extended` at all** — a source that resolves is not a source that supports the
  claim. Check the content, not the status code.

The user-agent tokens originally came from general knowledge and were only then checked against the
operator docs — which is how the incomplete list (missing `ChatGPT-User` and `OAI-AdsBot`) got caught.
**Re-fetch these before advising any `robots.txt` change.** A stale or misspelled user-agent in a
`robots.txt` is a silent no-op: it blocks nothing and no one tells you.

## Section: How to read GEO advice

Non-Google, and deliberately so: this section exists to judge the GEO literature, so it must cite it.

| Claim in SKILL.md | Source | Verified | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| GEO's most-cited evidence is Semrush's "AI Visibility Index"; the same article reports **40–60% of cited sources change month to month**; its tactics assert "likely" causation with no mechanism; its own caveats are "these principles increase your probability… they don't guarantee it" and "what works today may shift as models update" | [What is GEO — Search Engine Land](https://searchengineland.com/what-is-generative-engine-optimization-geo-444418) | 2026-07-12 | **Interested source**, cited *as an example of the genre*, not as authority: Semrush sells AI-visibility tooling. The 40–60% churn figure is the useful part, precisely because it undercuts the article's own advice. |
| Prediction pieces are bullish, forward-looking, and light on caution — tier-4 by construction | [AI search predictions for 2026 — Search Engine Land](https://searchengineland.com/ai-search-visibility-seo-predictions-2026-468042) | 2026-07-12 | Read for what the industry *believes*; never as input to a recommendation. |
| The GEO tactics an agent must be able to recognize when a stakeholder proposes them (semantic chunking, entity and citation engineering) | [GEO strategies](https://searchengineland.com/generative-engine-optimization-strategies-446723), [Planning for GEO in 2026](https://searchengineland.com/plan-for-geo-2026-evolve-search-strategy-463399) — Search Engine Land | 2026-07-12 | Google's AI optimization guide contradicts the chunking advice directly — see the Google table above. That contradiction is the point. |

**Why sources you disagree with belong in a provenance table.** A table that cites only what you agree
with is not provenance, it is confirmation. The GEO literature is here so the agent can quote it,
locate its conflicts of interest, and turn its own numbers and caveats against its headline. You
cannot corroborate a position by reading one side of it — and Google, on the question of whether
Google's AI surfaces need special optimization, is not a neutral party either. Where the two agree
(no special markup, no chunking), the claim is strong. Where only one speaks, say so.

## Section: Content extraction and semantic HTML

Backing `./extraction.md` and the extraction bullet in "What is mechanically true". Unusually for
this skill, the strongest source here is **code rather than a vendor statement** — an extractor's
behaviour is not a matter of opinion, and it is the one part of the AI pipeline you can read.

| Claim in SKILL.md / extraction.md | Source | Verified | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Readability scores `SECTION,H2–H6,P,TD,PRE`; base scores `DIV +5`, `PRE/TD/BLOCKQUOTE +3`, lists `−3`, `H1–H6/TH −5`; class weight `±25`; `okMaybeItsACandidate` and `unlikelyCandidates` test **class and id**, not tags; score scaled by `(1 − linkDensity)` with "5% or less" named as good; `<aside>`/`<footer>` conditionally removed in `_prepArticle()` | [`Readability.js`](https://github.com/mozilla/readability) | 2026-08-02 | **Tier 1 for its own behaviour** — read from the algorithm, not from a description of it. Actively developed; these constants drift. Re-read before treating a number as current. |
| `<article>` and `<main>` receive no tag-level initialization bonus | same | 2026-08-02 | The finding that overturns the usual advice. The `article`/`main` rescue is a class/id regex match. |
| trafilatura: precision 0.914 / recall 0.904 / F1 0.909 on 750 documents; goose3 0.934 precision but 0.690 recall | [trafilatura evaluation](https://trafilatura.readthedocs.io/en/latest/evaluation.html), benchmark dated 2022-05-18 | 2026-08-02 | The maintainer's own benchmark — **interested source.** Trust the ordering more than the absolutes. The load-bearing point is the recall column: the best extractor still loses ~10% of main content. |
| Semantic HTML is not a Google ranking factor; fixing heading hierarchy will not improve rankings | John Mueller, quoted consistently across SEO trade press | 2026-08-02 | **Corroborated, not primary.** Not fetched from Google Search Central this pass. Consistent with this skill's existing position that structured data is not an AI lever. |
| No AI vendor documents its extraction internals | absence of evidence | 2026-08-02 | Stated as an absence, which is the honest form. Anyone claiming vendor X privileges tag Y is guessing. |

## Sources that live in the SEO skill

These two files are deliberately split, and claims cross the boundary. Do not duplicate a row — look
it up in `.agents/skills/ref-sp-web-seo/references/sources.md`, which owns:

- **Bing's Webmaster Guidelines** in full — including the crawl, rendering, and link-discovery
  corroboration, and the note that the page is a JavaScript shell requiring a real browser to read.
- **RFC 9309** (`robots.txt` is a request, not enforcement) — the standard underneath every crawler
  decision in this skill.
- **Google's JavaScript SEO basics** — the crawl/render/index pipeline; the reason "be renderable
  without JS" is the one load-bearing AI requirement.
- **Next.js `htmlLimitedBots`** — why a non-JS bot outside a hardcoded User-Agent list can receive
  metadata it cannot read.
- **The rater guidelines** (`references/content-quality.md`) — what "worth citing" actually means.
- **The claim-tiering rule** — the four tiers this skill applies to GEO advice.

## What does not rot

The epistemic content — claim-tiering, refusing to ship unvalidated tactics as recommendations,
labelling mechanical versus speculative, and the diagnostic that *impressions steady + clicks falling*
points at an AI answer rather than a demotion. That is method. It survives whatever Google ships next,
and it is the reason this skill stays useful between verifications.
