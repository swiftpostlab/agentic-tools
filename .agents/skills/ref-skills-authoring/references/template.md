# Skill Title

## Purpose

One-sentence description of the capability or workflow this skill gives the agent.

## When to use this skill

- Trigger condition 1.
- Trigger condition 2.

## Core Workflow

1. First inspect the relevant inputs.
2. Follow the default procedure.
3. Validate the result before finalizing.

## Defaults

- Preferred tool, command, library, or approach.
- Fallback only when the default does not apply.

## Task Framing

Use this table when the skill includes important commands or operational steps:

| Command or action | What | Why | When | Expected outcome |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `./scripts/example.py --input data.json` | Briefly state what the step does. | Explain why the step matters. | State when to use it. | State what success looks like. |

## Gotchas

- Non-obvious repo or domain fact the agent will likely miss.
- Important constraint or failure mode.

## Validation

- Required checks, scripts, or references to run before concluding.

## References

- Read `./references/example.md` when a specific condition is true.
- Read `C:/absolute/path/to/other-skill/SKILL.md` only when you intentionally need to hand off to another skill.

## Scripts

- `./scripts/example.py` does X. Run it when Y is needed.

## Examples

```md

Adapt the template to the real repo before keeping it:

- Choose `ref-...` when the skill mainly informs the agent and `tool-...` when the skill mainly drives an action-oriented workflow.
- Add `agentic-tools-category` as one short lowercase domain category. In this repo, read `.agents/skills/ref-swiftpost-agents-categories/SKILL.md` before inventing a new category.
- If you use `tool-...`, make the name read like an action rather than a passive topic.
- If the skill should be exportable, set `shareable-skills.visibility: "shareable"`. If it depends on this repo's concrete layout, policies, or wrappers, set it to `"repo-local"` instead.
- If the skill has hard dependencies on other skills, add `shareable-skills.requires` as a space-separated list of skill names.
- If the skill is `repo-local` for a non-obvious reason, add `shareable-skills.reason` with a short explanation.
- Replace placeholder names, commands, and file paths.
- Keep placeholders synthetic. Do not turn generic examples into copies of real folder or script names from another repo unless the skill is intentionally documenting that concrete repo.
- Rewrite the `description` so it triggers on realistic user intent.
- Remove sections that do not add value for the skill's actual responsibility.
- Keep critical gotchas in `SKILL.md` and move bulky detail into `references/`, `assets/`, or `scripts/`.
- Use relative paths for this skill's own files and repo-root-relative paths for other skills in this repo.
- If the skill includes commands or task steps, frame them with what, why, when, and expected outcome.
- If the workflow is fragile or multistep, add an explicit plan-validate-execute loop.
