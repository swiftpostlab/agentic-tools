# Local Conventions

Use this file when you need to know which `ref-skills-authoring` rules are intentional repo conventions rather than part of the official Agent Skills references.

## Purpose

This document records local extensions, interpretations, and stricter conventions used in this repository.

These conventions are allowed, but they should not be mistaken for official Agent Skills spec requirements.

## Conventions Registry

| Convention | Why we use it | Relationship to original references | Review trigger | Last verified |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Use absolute filesystem paths when referencing another skill. | Cross-skill references are otherwise easy to resolve incorrectly across different clients, sandboxes, and working directories. | The original docs explicitly support relative paths for files inside the current skill, but they do not define a stable cross-skill reference convention. | Revisit if Agent Skills publishes an explicit cross-skill reference standard. | 2026-05-01 |
| Use relative paths for files inside the current skill. | This matches the official skill-root relative reference model and keeps local references portable. | Directly aligned with the official references. | Revisit only if the official spec changes. | 2026-05-01 |
| Prefix reference-heavy skills with `ref-` and action-heavy skills with `tool-`. | The prefix makes the skill's role discoverable before the agent loads the body. It also distinguishes passive guidance from action workflows. | This is a local naming convention layered on top of the base Agent Skills name constraints. | Revisit if the repo's skill mix changes or if a better role signal proves more reliable. | 2026-05-09 |
| Track skill exportability and hard skill dependencies in `metadata` using `shareable-skills.visibility`, `shareable-skills.requires`, and `shareable-skills.reason`. | Names should stay focused on discovery and activation, while metadata can drive export and dependency tooling without polluting the trigger surface. | This is a local convention built on top of the spec's arbitrary string metadata field. | Revisit if Agent Skills standardizes shareability or dependency metadata. | 2026-05-10 |
| Use the `what / why / when / expected outcome` framing pattern for important commands or actions. | Bare command lists are ambiguous. This structure makes task intent, trigger conditions, and success criteria explicit. | The exact pattern is local, but it is supported conceptually by the original planning, reasoning, communication, and tool-use material. | Revisit if it proves too heavy or if a better pattern emerges from real skill revisions. | 2026-05-01 |
| Treat `task_framing_expectations` in the eval example JSON as a local example field. | It helps document what a good workflow-oriented result should contain. | Not part of the official eval schema described in the Agent Skills evaluation guide. | Revisit if we want strict schema fidelity in all example files. | 2026-05-01 |
| Keep traceability and conventions docs under `ref-skills-authoring/references/` rather than the entry `SKILL.md`. | This preserves progressive disclosure and keeps the entry skill focused on operational guidance. | Consistent with the original progressive-disclosure model. | Revisit only if the package becomes too fragmented. | 2026-05-01 |

## Convention Details

## Absolute Cross-Skill Paths

Decision:

- When one skill needs to reference a different skill, use an absolute filesystem path.

Reason:

- The official references clearly support same-skill relative paths, but do not define a stable cross-skill reference convention.
- Absolute paths remove ambiguity across clients, working directories, and sandbox setups.

Scope:

- Applies only to references that leave the current skill directory.

## Same-Skill Relative Paths

Decision:

- Use relative paths for files that live inside the current skill.

Reason:

- This matches the official skill-root relative reference model.
- It keeps same-skill references portable and concise.

Scope:

- Applies to `./references/...`, `./scripts/...`, `./assets/...`, and similar in-skill paths.

## Skill Role Prefixes

Decision:

- Use `ref-...` for reference-heavy skills and `tool-...` for action-heavy skills.

Reason:

- The prefix signals the skill's job before the agent loads the full file.
- It distinguishes passive guidance from user-invoked workflows more clearly than a generic name does.

Scope:

- Applies to skill folder names and frontmatter `name` fields in this repo.

## Shareability Metadata

Decision:

- Use `shareable-skills.visibility` with `shareable` or `repo-local`.
- Use `shareable-skills.requires` as a space-separated string of hard dependency skill names.
- Use `shareable-skills.reason` as an optional short explanation when a skill is repo-local or a dependency is not obvious.

Reason:

- The Agent Skills spec exposes `metadata` as a string-to-string mapping, so a flat string encoding is the simplest portable way to track exportability and dependencies.
- Names should keep describing the skill's function for activation quality instead of being repurposed for packaging labels like `internal-...` or `shareable-...`.
- Future tooling can parse these keys to copy, validate, or export only the intended skills and their hard dependencies.

Scope:

- Applies to skills in this repo when we need to track whether they are meant to be shared and which other skills they require.

## Task Framing Pattern

Decision:

- For important commands or operational actions, we may frame the step with `what`, `why`, `when`, and `expected outcome`.

Reason:

- Bare command lists are often too ambiguous for reliable agent behavior.
- This structure makes the trigger condition, purpose, and success signal explicit.

Scope:

- Use when the skill has multiple commands, branching steps, or steps that are easy to misuse.

## Eval Example Extension

Decision:

- The `task_framing_expectations` field in the eval example JSON is treated as a local example extension.

Reason:

- It helps describe workflow-quality expectations in examples.
- It is not part of the official Agent Skills evaluation format.

Scope:

- Applies to local example files and documentation in this repo.

## Traceability Docs Placement

Decision:

- Keep traceability and local-conventions docs in `ref-skills-authoring/references/` instead of the entry `SKILL.md`.

Reason:

- This preserves progressive disclosure and keeps the entry skill operational.

Scope:

- Applies to deep explanatory material for this skill.

## Use Rule

Before adding a new convention to `ref-skills-authoring`, ask:

1. Is this directly required by the original references?
2. If not, does it solve a real ambiguity or repeated failure in this repo?
3. Should it be labeled as local so future readers do not confuse it with the standard?

If the answer to 2 is no, do not add the convention.

## Change Rule

Whenever a local convention is added or removed:

- update this file,
- update `./source-traceability.md`,
- and make the affected examples or templates match the decision.
