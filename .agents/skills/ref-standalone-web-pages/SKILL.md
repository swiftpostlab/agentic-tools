# Standalone Web Pages

## Purpose

Provide portable defaults for self-contained web pages and browser-only tools that should stay simple, readable, and maintainable without unnecessary framework or build-system overhead.

## When to use this skill

- Creating a standalone HTML page or mini web tool.
- Refactoring a single-file page that is getting too large.
- Deciding whether local CSS or JS should stay inline or be extracted.
- Reviewing the structure of a browser-only feature.

## Scope Boundaries

- Use this skill for browser-only pages and local tools you control directly.
- Use `.agents/skills/ref-userscript/SKILL.md` when the code runs inside a userscript manager on someone else's page.
- Use `.agents/skills/ref-javascript/SKILL.md` for broader JavaScript and JSDoc questions that are not primarily about standalone-page structure.
- Use `.agents/skills/ref-architecture/SKILL.md` when the question is about repo-wide structure rather than one independent page or tool.

## Defaults

- Start with one self-contained HTML file for small and medium tools.
- Use semantic HTML before reaching for generic containers.
- Prefer `.js` for ordinary local browser scripts and `.mjs` when explicit browser-module boundaries improve clarity.
- Keep styles and scripts local unless extraction clearly improves readability.
- Treat each standalone tool as an independent unit.
- Avoid introducing frameworks or shared build infrastructure unless the user asks for them.

## Task Framing

| Command or action | What | Why | When | Expected outcome |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Start with the smallest viable page | Keep HTML, CSS, and JS local until complexity proves extraction is needed. | Standalone tools become harder to move and maintain once they inherit premature infrastructure. | When creating a new browser-only tool. | The page is easy to open, reason about, and iterate on. |
| Split a growing page locally | Extract sibling CSS or JS files inside the same folder when the inline version gets hard to scan. | Local extraction improves readability without creating cross-page coupling. | When one file is becoming mentally heavy. | Structure is clearer but the tool still ships as an independent unit. |
| Review browser-tool boundaries | Decide whether data storage, helpers, or assets should stay local to one page. | Shared runtime layers create hidden dependencies faster than most standalone tools need. | When a page starts accumulating helpers or data files. | The page stays independent unless reuse is real and deliberate. |

## Core Rules

### Structure

- Use semantic sections such as `header`, `main`, `section`, `form`, and `dialog` where they fit.
- Keep the page layout obvious from the markup alone.
- Extract CSS or JS into local sibling files only when the inline version becomes hard to scan.

### File conventions

- Keep the main page on `.html`.
- Use `.mjs` for extracted browser modules only when the module boundary is real and helpful, not just because ESM is available.
- If a page ships with a related userscript, keep the userscript beside it and use `.user.js` or `.user.ts` explicitly.

### JavaScript organization

- Keep a predictable order: constants, state, element lookup, pure helpers, rendering, events, initialization.
- Extract repeated transformations and persistence helpers before extracting global infrastructure.
- Keep storage keys, labels, and other repeated values in named constants.

### Independence

- Assume one standalone page should not need another page's runtime files.
- If local assets or helpers exist, keep them inside the same page folder.
- Only create shared runtime layers when the user explicitly wants repository-wide reuse.

## Example Layouts

### Single-file local tool

```text
src/features/json-inspector/
  json-inspector.html
```

### Standalone page with local sibling assets

```text
src/features/report-viewer/
  index.html
  css/styles.css
  js/app.js
  assets/empty-state.svg
```

## Validation

- The page remains understandable without framework knowledge.
- HTML is semantic, JS responsibilities are clear, and repeated values are named.
- Local extraction improved readability instead of adding ceremony.
- The tool does not introduce hidden coupling to unrelated pages.
