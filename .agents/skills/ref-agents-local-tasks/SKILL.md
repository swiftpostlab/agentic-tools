# Agents Local Tasks

## Purpose

Define how this repo uses `.agents/tasks/` as a gitignored local workspace for backlog tracking, working notes, temporary delivery artifacts, and per-task execution context.

## When to use this skill

- Reading or updating `.agents/tasks/TODO.md`.
- Creating or maintaining `.agents/tasks/<task-name>/` for a multi-step task.
- Storing temporary working files such as `pr-description.md`, `notes.md`, `validation.md`, or `plan.md`.
- Reviewing whether local task files still match the active work.

## Core Workflow

1. Check `.agents/tasks/TODO.md` when the work belongs to a larger local backlog or set of follow-up items.
2. Decide whether the item is simple enough to execute directly or whether it needs clarification or refinement first.
3. Use one kebab-case folder per active task under `.agents/tasks/<task-name>/` when the work is complex enough to need a dedicated local workspace.
4. Keep one anchor file for the task when the work is broad enough to need a running brief, explicit subtasks, or a refinement record.
5. Update progress, blockers, assumptions, and next steps as the task changes.
6. Remove or refresh stale local files once the task is done or no longer relevant.

## Directory Model

| Path | Role |
| --- | --- |
| `.agents/tasks/TODO.md` | Local top-level backlog for follow-up work in this repo. |
| `.agents/tasks/<task-name>/` | Local workspace for one task or PR-sized slice. |
| `.agents/tasks/<task-name>/README.md` | Preferred living brief when the task needs ongoing status, plan, and context. |
| `.agents/tasks/<task-name>/pr-description.md` | Temporary draft content for a PR or summary. |
| `.agents/tasks/<task-name>/notes.md`, `validation.md`, `plan.md` | Scratch notes, validation results, or a focused local plan. |
| `.agents/playground/` | Scratch space for temporary helper scripts or generated local artifacts that should be created with edit tools instead of terminal file-writing commands. |

## Backlog Syntax

Unfinished top-level items in `.agents/tasks/TODO.md` may use any of these forms:

```markdown
- todo item description
- [] todo item description
- [ ] todo item description
```

Completed items should use `[x]`:

```markdown
- [x] completed todo item description
```

When a helper script needs to find the next open task, treat plain bullets, empty brackets, and spaced empty brackets as open items, and skip `[x]` or `[X]` items.

## Task Framing

| Command or action | What | Why | When | Expected outcome |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Update `.agents/tasks/TODO.md` | Refresh the local backlog across active work. | The top-level TODO should reflect the current local priority list. | When new follow-up work appears, priorities change, or an item is completed. | The top-level backlog matches the real state of the work. |
| Triage one TODO item | Decide whether the item can be done directly or needs clarification first. | Simple tasks should not be over-processed, while broad or underdefined tasks should not be executed on guesswork. | When starting a new unchecked item from `.agents/tasks/TODO.md`. | The next step is explicit: execute immediately, ask clarifying questions, or open a local task brief first. |
| Create `.agents/tasks/<task-name>/` | Open a local workspace for one task or PR-sized slice. | Keeping one folder per task prevents unrelated notes from mixing together. | When a task is large enough to need its own running notes or temporary artifacts. | The task has a clearly named local workspace. |
| Add or update an anchor file such as `README.md` or `plan.md` | Keep a running summary of objective, status, blockers, and next steps. | Multi-step work becomes hard to recover if the local context is scattered across chat only. | When the task has enough moving parts that a single summary file will reduce drift. | Another pass can resume the task from the local file without reconstructing context from scratch. |
| Store a temporary artifact such as `pr-description.md` or `validation.md` | Save work product that is useful during the task but does not belong in the committed repo. | Temporary drafts and scratch outputs should stay near the task they support. | When you need a local draft, notes, or validation log for the active task. | The artifact is easy to find and scoped to the right task folder. |
| Prune stale local files | Remove or update local tracking that no longer reflects real work. | Gitignored local notes become misleading if they outlive the task or drift from the code. | After scope changes, task completion, or abandonment. | `.agents/tasks/` stays useful instead of becoming a graveyard of stale notes. |

## Decision Rules

- Treat `.agents/tasks/` as local working state, not as committed product documentation.
- Keep `.agents/tasks/` gitignored and promote durable guidance elsewhere instead of relying on local notes to survive cloning or review.
- If a TODO item is simple and well-defined, execute it directly instead of forcing a planning ritual first.
- If a TODO item is broad, ambiguous, or underdefined, ask the missing questions first and treat that clarification as part of the task rather than guessing.
- If a TODO item needs refinement before implementation, create `.agents/tasks/<task-name>/README.md` and capture the clarified goal, assumptions, and subtasks there before starting execution.
- If the work still cannot be executed cleanly after initial clarification, run an interactive breakdown with the user and record the resulting subtasks in the task `README.md`.
- If a TODO item relies on an incorrect assumption, state the problem calmly, explain the misunderstanding, and correct it with the user before proceeding.
- Prefer task- or PR-style, kebab-case folder names such as `.agents/tasks/add-button-for-language/`.
- When a temporary helper script or generated scratch file is needed, put it under `.agents/playground/` and create or edit it with the edit tools rather than shell heredocs, redirection, or inline terminal-generated files.
- Do not require every task folder to have a `README.md`. Use one only when the work needs a durable running brief.
- If the folder only needs a narrow temporary artifact, store that file directly without inventing extra structure.
- If a local note becomes durable repo guidance, promote it into a committed doc, skill, or code comment instead of leaving it only under `.agents/tasks/`.
- Do not overwrite unrelated task folders when the active task changes; keep local notes scoped to the task they belong to.

## Gotchas

- `.agents/tasks/` is normally gitignored, so other collaborators and future clones will not see it unless the content is promoted elsewhere.
- Local tracking can drift from the code if it is not updated after scope changes.
- A temporary draft under `.agents/tasks/` is not a substitute for updating the actual repo source of truth when the information becomes permanent.
- Broad TODO text is not authorization to improvise missing requirements; refine it first when the scope is unclear.
- A broken premise in a TODO item should be corrected, not silently worked around.

## Example Next-Todo Readers

Use examples like these as temporary helpers under `.agents/playground/` when manual scanning is noisy. Keep them simple and delete them when they are no longer useful.

```python
from pathlib import Path
import re


TODO_PATH = Path(".agents/tasks/TODO.md")
DONE_LINE = re.compile(r"^-\s*\[[xX]\]\s+")
OPEN_LINE = re.compile(r"^-\s*(?:\[\s*\]\s*)?(?P<text>\S.*)$")


def find_next_todo(todo_path: Path) -> tuple[int, str] | None:
    for line_number, line in enumerate(
        todo_path.read_text(encoding="utf-8").splitlines(), start=1
    ):
        if DONE_LINE.match(line):
            continue

        match = OPEN_LINE.match(line)
        text = match.group("text").strip() if match else ""
        if text:
            return line_number, text

    return None


def main() -> None:
    todo_item = find_next_todo(TODO_PATH)
    if todo_item is None:
        print("No open todos found.")
        return

    line_number, text = todo_item
    print(f"{TODO_PATH}:{line_number}: {text}")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

```typescript
import { readFileSync } from "node:fs";

type TodoItem = {
  lineNumber: number;
  text: string;
};

const todoPath = ".agents/tasks/TODO.md";
const doneLine = /^-\s*\[[xX]\]\s+/;
const openLine = /^-\s*(?:\[\s*\]\s*)?(?<text>\S.*)$/;

const findNextTodo = (content: string): TodoItem | null => {
  const lines = content.split(/\r?\n/);

  for (const [index, line] of lines.entries()) {
    if (doneLine.test(line)) {
      continue;
    }

    const match = openLine.exec(line);
    const text = match?.groups?.text?.trim();
    if (text) {
      return { lineNumber: index + 1, text };
    }
  }

  return null;
};

const main = (): void => {
  const todoItem = findNextTodo(readFileSync(todoPath, "utf8"));
  if (!todoItem) {
    console.log("No open todos found.");
    return;
  }

  console.log(`${todoPath}:${todoItem.lineNumber}: ${todoItem.text}`);
};

main();
```

## Validation

- Any helper or workflow that scans `.agents/tasks/TODO.md` recognizes plain bullets, `[]`, and `[ ]` as open items, and skips `[x]` or `[X]` items.
- After a major shift in scope, confirm that `.agents/tasks/TODO.md` and the active task folder still describe the same task you are actually performing.
- Before concluding a task, check whether any durable guidance discovered in local notes should be moved into committed repo files.
